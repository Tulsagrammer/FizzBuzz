A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away ... well, maybe not that long 
ago: early 2015 to be a little more specific. I had some e-mail exchange 
with an acquaintance regarding the "FizzBuzz" algorithm that some 
organizations use as a screening test for new programmers. We had both 
been exchanging clever little algorithms to see which was more cryptic 
or faster or less code. I wound up collecting these algorithms along 
with some scaffolding code in order to run timing tests. This became the 
start of the "FizzBuzz2" project elsewhere in my Github repository.

Subsequently, FizzBuzz2 became a useful little platform for testing new 
design patterns that I became exposed to. FizzBuzz2 reached its pinnacle 
of success with a restructuring that allowed different output formats 
(HTML, JSON) to be generated with no change to the underlying FizzBuzz 
algorithm framework. But the project was still a single, static entity. 
New output formats could be accommodated with minimal code change, but 
the entire project still needed to be recompiled.

More recently, that acquaintance I was e-mailing a year ago presented a 
small program at our local .Net Developers group that illustrated how 
Reflection could be used in C# to support run-time "plug-ins". I was a 
little excited to see how easy it could be to provide alternative logic 
implementations without rebuilding the entire system. My immediate 
reaction was to try and implement the same type of plug-ins for 
FizzBuzz2. But this change would require some major restructuring of the 
solution; not knowing how Git would handle new and relocated files, I 
created a brand new project -- this one, FizzBuzz!

At the time this note was written FizzBuzz consists of four major 
components:

FizzBuzz
    The overall system driver
Engine
    A tiny little framework for executing FizzBuzz algorithms and
    collecting basic performance measurements.
Algorithm Plugins
    Implement specific FizzBuzz algorithms as plugins to the Engine.
Writer Plugins
    Generate output in various formats as plugins to FizzBuzz.
